##Motivation
This Thread on [r/ShowerThoughts](https://reddit.com/r/showerthoughts/):
[Reddit needs a youtube filter just like it's NSFW filter. There is nothing worse than clicking a youtube link when you thought it was a gif.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/4xvps2/reddit_needs_a_youtube_filter_just_like_its_nsfw/)

Also wanted to get my feet wet with making a Chrome extension as a developer.
